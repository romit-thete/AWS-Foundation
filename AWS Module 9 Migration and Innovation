AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF):
-- The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) organizes guidance into six areas of focus, called Perspectives.
-- These are:
-- Business Capabilities:
	- Business: 
		Ensures that IT aligns with business needs and that IT investments link to key business results.
		e.g., Business Managers, Finance managers, Budget owners, Strategy stakeholders.
	- People: 
		Supports development of an organization-wide change management strategy for successful cloud adoption.
		e.g., HR, Staffing, People managers
	- Governance: 
		Focuses on the skills and processes to align IT strategy with business strategy.
		e.g., Chief Information Officer (CIO), Program managers, Enterprise architects, BAs, Portfolio managers.
-- Technical Capabilities:
	- Platform:
		Includes principles and patterns for implementing new solutions on the cloud, and migrating on-premises workloads to the cloud.
		e.g., Chief Technology Officer (CTO), IT Managers, Solutions architects
	- Security:
		Ensures that the organization meets security objectives for visibility, auditability, control, and agility.
		e.g., Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), IT security managers, IT security analysts.
	- Operations:
		Helps you to enable, run, use, operate, and recover IT workloads to the level agreed upon with your business stakeholders.
		e.g., IT Operations managers, IT support managers.
		
-- 6 R's of migration:
1. Rehosting:
-- aka Lift and Shift.
-- Absolutely no effort needed, directly migrate on prem to AWS as is!
-- Some businesses won't even feel the need to change code, hence it is beneficial in only some cases.

2. Replatforming:
-- Lift, tinker, and shift.
-- No new dev efforts or code changes involved (ex: change DB from SQL to Amazon RDS).
-- The core architecture is not changed, only a few cloud optimizations are carried out to realize a benefit.

3. Retire:
-- Some parts of the on prem architecture is just not needed or not in use or have replacements.
-- AWS migration plan can be an opportunity to have these applications decomissioned.

4. Retain:
-- Retaining consists of keeping applications that are critical for the business in the source environment. 
-- This might include applications that require major refactoring before they can be migrated, or, work that can be postponed until a later time.
-- This also includes some apps which are about to be deco'ed but not immediately.
-- Only migrate to AWS what makes sense. These apps can live wherever they are and later on migrated in stages/deco'ed instead of having them moved to AWS right away.

5. Repurchase:
-- Common for companies that look forward to change the legacy software Vendors either due to end of license or simply just because they want a new vendor.
-- It involves moving from traditional license to a software-as-a-service model.
-- ex: Moving from one CRM vendor to a newer one (Salesforce), ending the licensing in favour of cloud-native DB offerings.
-- The catch here is that since these are new softwares totally, some are easy to implement whereas some might take time.
-- The total upfront expense thus goes a little higher but the benefits are better in the long run.

6. Refactoring/Re-architecting:
-- Here is where a new code is needed. 
-- But this needs a strong business need to add features or improve performance that might not be possible on prem but now it is, with AWS.
-- Highest initial cost for planning and efforts.

AWS Snow Family:
-- Every customer has large and large amounts of data which they need to be transferred onto AWS during the migration.
-- This is not possible over direct connect methods as for transferring large data like 100PB, having even 1GBps worth of speed would still take 100 days to transfer theoretically.
-- Here is where the AWS Snow Family comes into play! These are used to transfer loads of data from on prem to AWS without going over the Internet.
-- Below are the options:
1. AWS Snowcone
2. AWS Snowball
3. AWS Snowmobile
-- These devices offer different capacity points, and most include built-in computing capabilities. 
-- AWS owns and manages the Snow Family devices and integrates with AWS security, monitoring, storage management, and computing capabilities.  

1. AWS Snowcone:
-- Small, Rugged and secure edge computing and data transfer device.
-- Has 2 CPUs and 4 GB of memory and 8 TB of usable storage.

2. AWS Snowball:
-- This has two options:
	a. Snowball Edge Storage Optimized:
	- Suitable for large-scale data migrations.
	- 80 TB of HDD for block volumes and S3 compatible object storage and 1 TB of SATA SSD for block volumes.
	- 40 vCPUs and 80 GB of memory to support EC2 sbe1 instances.
	
	b. Snow Edge Compute Optimized:
	- Powerful computing resources hence useful for high compute demanding tasks: ML, Full motion video analysis, analytics and local computing stacks.
	- 42 TB HDD for S3 or EBS, 7.68 TB usable NVMe SSD for EBS.
	- 52 vCPUs and 208 GB of memory along with an optional Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU. Devices run EC2 sbe-c and sbe-g instances.
	
3. AWS Snowmobile:
-- Exabyte-scale data transfer service used to move extensively large amount of data to AWS.
-- It is actually a semi-trailer truck with a 45 foot long container and has 24/7 survillance and an escort vehicle guarding data all the time.
-- Upto 100 Petabytes worth of data can be transferred per Snowmobile.

Innovations with AWS:
-- AWS provides even more services for various application needs.
-- Some application needs/domains where AWS has its presence are as below:

1. Serverless applications:
	- Serverless: you dont need to provision/maintain/administer a server thus, no need to worry about fault tolerance or HA.
	- Building the architecture with serverless apps enables the devs to focus on their core product instead of managing and operating servers.
	- ex: AWS Lambda

2. Artificial Intelligence:
	- AWS offers a list of services in this domain:
		- Speech to text : Amazon Transcribe
		- Discover patterns in text : Amazon Comprehend
		- Identify potentially fraud online activities : Amazon Fraud Detector
		- Build Voice and text chatbots : Amazon Lex (Heart of Alexa)
		- Extract texts and data from documents : Amazon Textract

3. Machine Learning:
	- Traditional ML models are complex, expensive, time consuming and error prone.
	- Build, Train, Deploy ML based models : Amazon Sagemaker, Amazon Augmented AI (Amazon A2I), AWS Deepracer.
	- Sagemaker removes the difficult work from the process and empowers you to build efficient ML models quickly.
	- AWS DeepRacer is an autonomous 1/18 scale race car that you can use to test reinforcement learning models.
4. Intenet of Things.
5. It also allows you to own a Satellite! (pay on usage-basis) : AWS Ground Station
