Well Architected framework:
-- Designed to enable architects, devs and users to build secure, high performing, resilient and efficient infra.
-- AWS also provides a Well-Architected tool that helps to analyze and detect if your architecture is secure, efficient, high performing and cost effective!
-- It has 5 pillars:
1. Operational Excellence
2. Security
3. Reliablitiy
4. Performance Efficiency
5. Cost optimization


1. Operational Excellence:
-- Ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.  
-- Design principles: performing operations as code, annotating documentation, anticipating failure, and frequently making small, reversible changes.

2. Security:
-- Ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.
-- When considering the security of the architecture, apply the below:
	- Automate security best practices when possible.
	- Apply security at all layers.
	- Protect data in transit and at rest.

3. Reliablity:
-- Ability of a system to do the following:
	- Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions. (HA)
	- Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand. (Scalability)
	- Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues.
-- It includes: testing recovery procedures, scaling horizontally to increase aggregate system availability, and automatically recovering from failure.

4. Performance Efficiency:
-- Ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.
-- Evaluating the performance efficiency of your architecture includes experimenting more often, using serverless architectures, and designing systems to be able to go global in minutes.
-- A good example would be: selecting the right EC2 instance type for your workload!

5. Cost optimization:
-- Ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point. 
-- It includes: adopting a consumption model, analyzing and attributing expenditure, using managed services to reduce the cost of ownership.

Benefits of the AWS Cloud:
1. Trade fixed expense (Traditional) for Variable expense (AWS).
2. Benefit from massive economies of scale (at AWS).
3. Stop guessing capacity! (No need to have the estimate of capacity handy!)
4. Increase speed and agility.
5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers.
6. Go global in minutes.

1. Trade fixed expense for Variable expense:
-- This is an advantage as in AWS you pay as you use whereas in case of traditional ways, you might need to have an estimate of resources handy before using computing resources.

2. Benefit from massive economies of scale:
-- This is an advantage of cloud computing in itself. As usage from a bazillion customers aggregates on the cloud, companies like AWS can buy the hardware at bulk thus costing them less.
-- This is an advantage for the customers as it would in turn result to lower pay-as-you-go prices.

3. Stop guessing capacity:
-- No need to have the estimate of capacity handy!
-- You can launch EC2 instances when needed and pay only for the compute time you use.

4. Increase speed and agility:
-- With cloud computing, it is easier to develop and deploy applications.
-- The development teams only need to focus on their core tasks and thus get more time to experiment and innovate!

5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers:
-- Focus more on your applications and customers and less on the cloud computing tasks as AWS or other cloud providers take care of it for you, thus saving time, money and efforts.

6. Go global in minutes:
-- Quickly deploy apps to customers all around the world while providing low latency.
